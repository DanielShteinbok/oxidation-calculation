    "I have written two modules, `equations` and `values` to respectively define the equations used by Bjorck et al, and to provide the experimental conditions and values used for their experimental setups and which can be custom-defined. `first-investigation.ipynb` looked at the equations themselves and developed all of this logically, after which I transferred those equations to the aforementioned modules. This is simply a \"scratch pad\" to use those modules and test their validity, as well as to calculate things for the future."
